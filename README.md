Welcome to Blackjack! The game is simple.

For each round, you will initially place a bet. 

On the next page, you will play against the dealer. The goal is to have a total as close to 21 as possible, without going over. 

After your initial deal, make a decision on whether to hit (add another card to your hand) or stand (let the dealer play).

After each round, you will have the option to play again or return to the initial page. 

This game was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
